                            There's so much I want to say, but dont. I will drop all pretense of anything to be with you for only a solitary day. 
                            <br /><br />
                            I'll understand that you don't have the capacity to deal something like this right now. 
                            Nonetheless, I'm going to do it anyway. I'm pouring my heart out to you in the hopes that you'll read it someday. 
                            <br /><br />
                            I know we're in pursuit of achieving something incredible and significant in our own lives. 
                            I wish for your career will follow you through and you'll be a star at what you do. 
                            Just like how your folks named you. Continue to shine, no matter what route you take. 
                            <br /><br />
                            You are magnificent in every last bit of it. You are like a sun that is designed to mild up my reality. 
                            I can't hold on to have you and your mind is made up on me. 
                            I wish you could reclaim those words or arbitration and make me the one you will turn upward to and love totally. 
                            That is on the grounds that I like you with every fiber of my being.
                            <br /><br />
                            <strong>Love,</strong><br />
                            Not really your biggest fan, but someone who appreciates you dearly.
                            <br />
                            PS: I planned to write to you, on this page. Until this feelings fade.

                            Yesterday, I was frightened. Today, I am disheartened. 
                            <br /><br />
                            Turned up, in Iloilo, I was within your parameters. 
                            But I couldn’t give(deliver) you the gift that I painstakingly crafted for several days, a knitted bouquet along with sketches. 
                            I also want to give you lavish gifts but I’m an artist, I work with my hands and think this is the best way to express my sincerity for you. 
                            I know this is nothing compared to the expensive gifts that you might have received yesterday or long before that. 
                            But you are worth the effort. 
                            <br /><br />
                            It was Valentine’s day, and ironically, I don't have the heart to disturb you and the peace that you meticulously protected. 
                            Moreover, it is one of the reasons why I didn’t bother you, in the first place. 
                            I understand and believe that you deserve it. 
                            Besides, the person I am right now is someone that has so many “red flags”. 
                            (Whatever jargons, argots, lingo you fellas call it.) 
                            Therefore, I will not disrupt your peace for as long as I see myself as unfit and ineligible even to my own best possible epitome of person in pursuing you.
                            <br /><br />
                            I wish you happiness.
                            <br /><br />
